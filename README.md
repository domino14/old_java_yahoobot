# old_java_yahoobot
Old code I found somewhere that connected to Yahoo Games and ran trivia/etc

Around the summer of 2004 I became fascinated with trying to break the encryption used by Yahoo! Games, in particular
Literati (although they all basically worked the same way). Armed with a pad of paper, a pen, and whatever Wireshark
was called back then (Ethereal?) I eventually succeeded in breaking the encryption while in a tiny dorm room
in my university.

After that I wrote this bot to teach myself Java. It connected to the rooms, broke the encryption, and played a trivia
game with people.
